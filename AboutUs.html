            Zeyton Nutraceuticals, Lda. is a technological start-up specialised in 100% natural
            hydroxytytrosol, the olive polyphenol with clinically-proven cholesterol protecting
            properties. Its patented green technology to extract hydroxytyrosol from olive oil industry
            products was developed in collaboration with IBET (www.ibet.pt ) and Nova, the New
            University of Lisbon.

                    Zeyton Nutraceuticals aims at providing high quality, wholly natural extracts from obtained from olives paste, immediately after
                    oil extraction.<br />
                    These extracts are:
                    <br />
                    1) rich in olive polyphenols and standardised by their content in hydroxytyrosol, the anti-oxidant that protects cholesterol from
                    oxidation and helps prevent cardiovascular diseases;<br />
                    2) production takes place at the mill itself, provided with the latest equipments and conditions of excellence, side by side with
                    olive oil. It is obtained using only water and clean filtration processes that are highly selective for hydroxytyrosol, avoiding
                    contamination by any harmful substances. Zeyton Nutraceuticals continues to develop its patented processes through an
                    extensive network of R&D collaborations, and in particular with IBET, a Biotechnology research platform, REQUIMTE, a Green
                    Chemistry research centre of excellence, and Nova, the New University of Lisbon.

                Zeyton Nutraceuticals produces natural extract obtained from olives paste, immediately after oil extraction, using clean technology that respects the environment. Zeyton Nutraceuticals operates at a Portuguese olive mill, located in the south of the country, side by side with olive oil production.
            </div>
            <div class="content-10">
                There are no solvents or other chemical products used in the modular production process. The operations basically consists in physical
                separations, involving contact with inert materials. Used for several years in the food industry, these operations (centrifuging, filtering with
                membranes, drying) follow an innovative and simple enchainment allowing to obtain the main anti-oxidant ingredients from olive oil with
                health benefits. These properties were proved in the technical application delivered to the USA Patent Office that granted the American
                patent in 2011.
            </div>
            <div class="content-10">
                The extraction process has also been granted patents in Europe, Canada, South Africa, Algeria, Tunisia Morocco, and Brazil.

            <div class="content-10">
                Zeyton’s patents describes a very efficient process to extract olive’s most beneficial components from the semi-solid cake that results from
                virgin olive oil production.
            </div>
            <div class="content-10">
                It is a totally clean process. It adds only water to the cake, and no solvents or any other type of additives, and uses filtration with special
                membranes. These (nano)filtration membranes selectively let hydroxytyrosol pass through and retain most other cake components, including
                all deleterious substances that might have been absorbed from the environment or added by agricultural practices. The obtained extract is
                therefore totally safe.
            </div>
            <div class="content-10">
                Zeyton’s process simplicity is one of its main advantages, as a one-step filtration yields a highly enriched aqueous solution of hydroxytyrosol,
                which is further concentrated by reverse osmosis, a standard process commonly used to produce fresh water. A comparison of results with
                other more complex processes proposed in the technical literature has proved that Zeyton´s process is twice more effective in extracting
                hydroxytyrosol from a given amount of olive cake. Moreover, Zeyton’s extracts have higher antimicrobial activity and in vitro cellular
                antioxidant activity, even when the hydroxytyrosol amounts are adjusted to equivalent values.
