            Olive polyphenols are minor components of olives (2 to 3%), but
            exert important protective functions of the fruit content, namely the
            oil, as they are powerful antioxidants.
        </div>
        <div class="content white">
            <p>
                They belong to the families of tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol, substances that exist in Nature
                characteristically in the olive tree and in very few other plants. More than twenty years
                ago, it began to be realized that the healthy properties recognized in olive oil, and indeed
                in the famous Mediterranean diet, could owe a lot to these minor constituents of olive oil.
            </p>
            <p>
                The interest in those substances has grown progressively, and literally many hundreds of
                studies have been performed on their health protection effects. Dozens of clinical trials,
                involving sometimes hundreds of subjects, have begun to prove those effects.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first area where these clinical trials gave positive results was in cardiovascular health.
                In 2011, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has recognized that there was enough
                hard evidence that polyphenols in olive oils contribute to the protection of blood lipids from
                oxidative damage (oxidative damage to blood lipids is the process that launches plaque
                deposition in arteries, leading to cardiovascular diseases).
            </p>
            <p>
                In fact, the minimum quantities of olive oil polyphenols (hydrotyrosol, tyrosol and
                derivatives) that the EFSA considered should be taken to have a beneficial effect is
                positively minute – 5 mg/day. These substances are therefore powerful natural
                nutraceuticals even in small quantities.

            Olive oil polyphenols have been widely studied for promoting health. In fact, their strong antioxidant properties, and their ability to interfere in
            many metabolic processes are thought to give them antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, anticancer, and
            antidiabetic effects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dozens of clinical trials have been launched that probe the effects of olive polyphenols, alone or combined with other nutritional substances,
            on a wide range of diseases. Results that are coming out of those trials give evidence that olive polyphenols may help fight obesity, metabolic
            syndrome, osteoporosis.

            HYDROXYTYROSOL

            <div style="color:black;">
                Hydroxytyrosol is the most powerful antioxidant known in Nature. It is produced by
                the olive fruit to protect its oil from oxidation.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="content" style="margin-top:0px; float:left;">
            When olives are processed to yield olive oil, only small quantities of hydroxytyrosol go with
            the oil. The majority is retained in the solid biomass and waters that are discarded in olive
            mills.
            <p>
                Zeyton Nutraceuticals uses these waters to obtain formulations rich in hydroxytyrosol.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chemically, hydroxytyrosol has the name 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1,2-benzenediol, with the
                chemical formula C 8 H 10 O 3 . Hundreds of scientific publications describe its metabolic
                and health effects. It is regarded as having strong anti-inflammatory and anti-ageing
                properties.
